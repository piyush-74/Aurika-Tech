Hi please find my application of the dummy AMAZON Invoice maker(I have used amazon image from google):

Initially you need to download it from GitHub repository which I have used to submit the assignment.

After downloading please follow the below steps to run the program.

1) Once u have downloaded please run : npm init (to initialize the node dependencies)
2) Then cd invoiceapp
3) finally npm start 

This starts the application.



Explanation of each page:
1) App.js : used for the landing page
2) InvoiceForm.js: used to develop the logic for taking inputs and calculation of data
3) Invoice.js: USed to display the data which is being stored ie list the total price for the items
